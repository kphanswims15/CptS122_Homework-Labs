Review #1

advanced data types vs data structures
- adt is specific and data structures is for implementation

self-referential structures
- nodes, stacks and queeus

malloc() and free()
- malloc is used to allocate memory
- free is used to deallocate memory

compare and contrast linked lists, stacks, and queues
- linked list is a linear list that can go through the whole list
- stacks is last in first out - example: stack of plates
- queues is first in first out - example: grocery line
