Programming Assignment: PA 6: Morse Code Lookup BST

Date: March 21, 2016

Date Last Modified: March 22, 2016

Description: In this assignment you will be using a BST to convert English characters to Morse code strings. Morse code is a 
		famous coding scheme that assigns a series of dots and dashes to each letter of the alphabet, each digit, and a few 
		special characters. In sound-oriented systems, the dot represents a short sound and the dash represents a long sound. 
		Other representations of dots and dashes are used with light-oriented systems and signal-flag systems.
